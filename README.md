# 중앙대 오늘 뭐먹지 ?

22016년 초 레일즈 처음 공부할 때 엉망으로 만들던 코드를 전부 교체함.

### Things I have covered:

* Ajax load

* Polymorphic comments

* Generating seed data

* Combining two different models through one controller

### Things I have not covered yet:

* 'Like' action for comments ( also sorting based on it )

* Implement Google AdSense

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

### Unsolved Bugs that need to be fixed:

* Error on the last section of comment lists ( some odd comment appears )
